Mamba leverages conda, the basics of what you need to know is, `mamba` is very fast so you want to use it to manage your packages, install them or delete them for example, and we're going to use `conda` to manage our environments, create, delete and modify them. A workflow to start a new conda environment might look like the following:\n",

There's a lot to explore, thankfully odds are someone already created what you need or something close to what you need and they made it freely available on Github action's marketplace, if you have an idea for a workflow you'd like to automate I'd highly recommended having a look on [what's around](https://github.com/marketplace) before tackling the issue."
