    "## The FAIR principles\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2014, a core set of principles were drafted in order to optimise the reusability of research data, named the FAIR Data Principles. They represent a community-developed set of guidelines and best practices to ensure that data or any digital object are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Findable**: The first thing to be in place to make data reusable is the possibility to find them. It should be easy to find the data and the metadata for both humans and computers. Automatic and reliable discovery of datasets and services depends on machine-readable persistent identifiers (PIDs) and metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accessible**: The (meta)data should be retrievable by their identifier using a standardised and open communications protocol, possibly including authentication and authorisation. Also, metadata should be available even when the data are no longer available.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interoperable**: The data should be able to be combined with and used with other data or tools. The format of the data should therefore be open and interpretable for various tools, including other data records. The concept of interoperability applies both at the data and metadata level. For instance, the (meta)data should use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Re-usable**: Ultimately, FAIR aims at optimising the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings. Also, the reuse of the (meta)data should be stated with (a) clear and accessible license(s)."
